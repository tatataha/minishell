# Minishell

The Minishell project aims to create a user-friendly shell environment. It includes features such as command history, accurate command execution, signal handling, proper handling of quotes, redirections, and pipes, as well as expanding environment variables. Additionally, it manages interactive user interface behaviors like responding to key combinations such as ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\ as expected. The shell also provides built-in commands like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit for efficient shell usage.
